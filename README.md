## Beato’s Random Picker:

### About:
Beato’s Random Picker is a simple random picker like any other but stylized in the character Beatrice from Umineko no Naku Koro ni Visual Novel by Ryukishi07. This project was built to practice core front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, animations, localStorage, and basic state management using vanilla JavaScript.

### Functionalities:
Users can add multiple options to a list, save them as named presets, and reload those presets later with a single click. Once the list is ready, the app randomly selects one option for the user.

### Features:
- Add and remove choices dynamically;
- Random choice selection;
- Save presets with custom names;
- Load saved presets into the list;
- Persistent data using localStorage;
- Interactive UI feedback based on user actions/
