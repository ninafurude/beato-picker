Beato’s Random Picker
Beato’s Random Picker is a simple and interactive web application designed to help users make decisions when they are unsure what to choose.

Users can add multiple options to a list, save them as named presets, and reload those presets later with a single click. Once the list is ready, the app randomly selects one option for the user.

This project was built to practice core front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, animations, localStorage, and basic state management using vanilla JavaScript.

Features:

Add and remove choices dynamically;
Random choice selection;
Save presets with custom names;
Load saved presets into the list;
Persistent data using localStorage;
Interactive UI feedback based on user actions/
